Supplementary Data 3 – MCAS Processed Data

Files:
- integrated_matrix.csv : Concatenated PCA components per omics layer (meta_PC*, metabo_PC*, epi_PC*), one row per SampleID.
- labels.csv            : Binary target for model training (Class: 0=healthy/younger, 1=vascular-aged).

Notes:
- This dataset was derived from Yatsunenko et al. (2012), Nature, 486(7402), 222–227 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11053).
- Publicly available data from MG-RAST were used: qiime:850 (16S) and qiime:621 (shotgun).
- The column format expected by MCAS_scripts.txt has been preserved: SampleID + 6 features (2 PCA components per omics layer).
- The feature space can be extended by adding more PCA components if desired.

Provenance:
- Source data: Yatsunenko et al. (2012), MG-RAST open-access datasets.
- This file represents processed outputs generated within the MCAS pipeline.
